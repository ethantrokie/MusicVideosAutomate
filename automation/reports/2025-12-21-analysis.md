# Weekly Performance Analysis - 2025-12-21

## Summary
- Videos analyzed: 15
- Total views: 5,964
- Total engagement: 65 (likes + comments + shares)

## Insights
- Videos with 72%+ retention (Photoelectric Effect: 72.56%, Quantum Entanglement: 57.18%) significantly outperform the median 34%. These are both quantum physics topics with strong narrative hooks.
- The bat video achieved 99.94% retention with only 1 view, suggesting animal/nature topics may have broader appeal. Topic diversity could improve algorithmic distribution beyond physics-only content.

## Recommendations

### Auto-Applied (High Confidence)
- None this week

### Pending Review (Medium Confidence)
- Increase video duration to capture more watch time from high-retention viewers: Top performers (Photoelectric Effect, Quantum Entanglement) are sustaining attention beyond current length. 50s allows deeper explanation while staying under 1-minute threshold for short-form algorithms. (confidence: 0.82)
- Reduce media items density to improve visual comprehension: At 35s with 12-20 items, cuts occur every 1.75-2.9s. High retention videos likely benefit from clearer visual storytelling. Fewer, longer clips reduce cognitive load. (confidence: 0.78)

### Rejected
- None

## Changes Applied
- No changes applied this week

## Next Week Focus
- Monitor impact of applied changes
- Continue tracking retention metrics
