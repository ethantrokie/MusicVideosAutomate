## Recommendations

### Auto-Applied (High Confidence)

- Increase video duration to capture complete explanations: Best retention videos (GPS 45.54%, Noise-Canceling 46.42%, Lighter 49.31%) suggest audience stays for substantive content. 10s increase allows better narrative arc without losing short-form appeal (confidence: 0.78)
