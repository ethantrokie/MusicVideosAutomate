## Recommendations

### Auto-Applied (High Confidence)
- None this week

### Pending Review (Medium Confidence)
- Reduce video duration to optimize for high retention pattern: Top retention video (Doppler Effect: 91.29%) was shortest format. Jet Engine at 69% retention suggests sweet spot at 20-30s where viewers complete full watch (confidence: 0.82)
- Reduce media item count to strengthen narrative focus: High retention videos likely have tighter visual-concept mapping. Fewer transitions at 25s duration (2.5s per clip) creates smoother viewing experience vs current 2.2s pace (confidence: 0.78)

### Rejected
- None
