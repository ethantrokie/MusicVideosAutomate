# Weekly Performance Analysis - 2025-12-28

## Summary
- Videos analyzed: 14
- Total views: 6,995
- Total engagement: 99 (likes + comments + shares)

## Insights
- Videos with 80%+ retention (dXuSrdI47VU: 82.38%, _BrpqlGQrbM: 82.02%, 9s6FCh5n9aM: 82.84%) achieve 3-5x higher engagement (12-17 likes, 1+ shares) compared to lower retention videos
- Lower retention videos (36-48% range) still get views but minimal engagement, suggesting the 35s duration may be too long for certain topics or pacing needs optimization

## Recommendations

### Auto-Applied (High Confidence)
- None this week

### Pending Review (Medium Confidence)
- video_duration_seconds: High-performing videos maintain 80%+ retention, suggesting viewers complete ~25-28 seconds. Reducing to 30s targets this natural completion point, potentially boosting retention across all videos while maintaining educational completeness (confidence: 0.78)
- media_items_count: With shorter 30s duration, reducing media density from 2.9-1.75 sec/item to 3-2.1 sec/item allows each visual to register more clearly, reducing cognitive load and improving information retention (confidence: 0.72)

### Rejected
- None
